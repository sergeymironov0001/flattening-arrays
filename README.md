# flattening-arrays


The code solves the problem of flattening arrays.
  
For example if we have an array like the following
`[[1, 2],[3, 4, 5], [6, 7, 8, 9]]` it should returns `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]`

Another examples:  
`[[[1, [2]], [3, 4, 5]], [6, [7, [8]], 9]]`   
`[[1, [2, [[3]]]], 4, [5, [[[6]]]]]`
